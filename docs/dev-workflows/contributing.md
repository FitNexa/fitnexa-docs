# Contributing Guide

Welcome to the FitNexa development community! This guide outlines our standards and workflow.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow
1. **Branching**: Use `feature/`, `fix/`, or `refactor/` prefixes.
2. **Commits**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
3. **PRs**: All pull requests must pass linting and unit tests.

## 📏 Coding Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode is enabled. No `any`.
- **API Requests**: Always use `ApiClient` from `@fitnexa/shared`.
- **Testing**: 80% coverage target for all new features.
