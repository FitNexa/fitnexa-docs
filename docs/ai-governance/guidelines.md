# AI Governance Guidelines

FitNexa leverages AI for workout generation, nutrition planning, and automated support. This document outlines our safety and quality standards.

## 🤖 Models
We primarily use **Google Gemini (Pro 1.5)** via the Vertex AI API.

## 🛡️ Safety Pillars
1. **Human-in-the-loop**: High-risk nutrition advice must be reviewed by gym staff.
2. **Transparency**: All AI-generated content is clearly labeled.
3. **Data Privacy**: No PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is sent to AI models.
