# System Overview

FitNexa is a multi-tenant fitness platform designed for gyms and fitness centers. It provides a full-stack solution including a mobile application for members, gym-specific admin portals, and a scalable microservices backend.

## 📱 Mobile & Web Clients

- **Landing Page**: A marketing site built with **Vite, React 19, and TailwindCSS v4**, deployed on Vercel.
- **Onboarding Wizard**: A self-service setup flow for new gym clients built with Vite, React, and TailwindCSS.
- **Gym Admin Portal**: A "Chameleon" React application that adapts its UI, branding, and available features based on the logged-in gym's configuration.
- **Super Admin Portal**: The management hub for onboarding new gyms, managing subscriptions, and system-wide settings.
- **FitNexa Mobile**: A React Native (Expo) application supporting multiple gym brands. It uses dynamic theming to present a bespoke experience for each gym.

## ⚙️ Backend Architecture

The backend is built as a set of Node.js microservices coordinated by an API Gateway.

## 🔄 Core Flows

1. **Authentication**: Handled by the **Identity Service**. Users receive a JWT that is stored locally and sent with all subsequent requests. Supports domain-enforcement for gym-specific logins.
2. **Onboarding Flow**: Landing page preview → Onboarding Wizard → backend orchestration (gym + admin + activation email) → account activation → Gym Admin dashboard → Gym Setup editor → UAT APK build via GitHub Actions → download and test. See [Gym Onboarding Flow](../features/gym-onboarding-flow.md) for full details.
3. **Dynamic Branding**: The "Chameleon Engine" stores gym-specific themes (colors, logos, assets) in **GymConfig**. Frontend apps fetch this at runtime and inject styles as CSS variables or React context.
4. **Wizard Flows**: The **Wizard Service** handles multi-step stateful flows (onboarding, feature setup), exposed via the gateway at `/wizard`. It also manages account activation tokens, email delivery (Mailjet API), and GitHub Actions build orchestration.
5. **Observability**: Every service ships logs asynchronously via **RabbitMQ** to a dedicated **Logging Service**, which stores them in **MongoDB** for centralized analysis.
